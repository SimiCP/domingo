Rules for Test 1 redo:

Problems #1, #2, #4, and #6 are only ones eligible

I'll record your new scores, after you've had a chance to
program these problems, and use them appropriately in figuring
your course grade.

It would be cheating to talk with anyone other than me about this test,
but I'd be glad to talk to you about anything on the test and related
material.

The test source file test1.tex is in this folder, so you can copy and
paste any code that appears on the paper sheets of the test.

On all the problems I'll be grading your code that the test asked for,



but you should use suitable main methods on each to test your work.

----------

Problem #1:  just make your own class with a main to test/demo your
method and the instance 
variables as in the problem, and your instance method getEveryOtherOne

Problem #2:  make a class Pile (start by copying and pasting from test1.tex)
and write in your code for the bodies of the methods top and add, and
write a main method that will test/demo your methods

Problem #4:  add your loop-based static 
method removeAllButLast to the OurList class

Problem #6:  add your recursion-based static
method removeAllButFirst to the OurList class
